### Example

```js
<ReactGitHubCalendar tooltips responsive/>
// tooltips = true, responsive = true

<ReactGitHubCalendar global_stats={false} cache={(12 * 60 * 60)*1000}/>
```

## With Next.js

If you want to use this component with Next.js, you have to use dynamic import to avoid SSR.

```js
const ReactGitHubCalendar = dynamic(() => import('react-ts-github-calendar'), {
  ssr: false,
});
```

Otherwise, you'll see the error

```
window is not defined

or

document is not defined
```

Sometimes, Streak & Contribution do not working well. (display 0)<br/>
It may be fixed if you leave it for a few days (because sometimes the changes take a long time to be reflected) or if you delete the cache and reload it.
